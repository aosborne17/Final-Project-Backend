# Logging

- Logging is a good way to keep track of information overtime by storing it in a logging file

- To create a logging file we simply specify the name of a file in our logging method

- We could use print statements but loggings gives us a greater depth of information


## The five logging levels

- DEBUG --> 10
- INFO --> 20
- WARNING --> 30
- ERROR --> 40
- CRITICAL --> 50


## Changing login format

- By default logging only shows us the level name, the logger ('root' in our case) and lastly the message
- We can add many things such as the time of the log etc
